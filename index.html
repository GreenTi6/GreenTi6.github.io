                                          I know that sounds like a lot to learn, but once you get used to it, things will get so much easier.
                                          <br>
                                          We will begin with the easier stuff in Blender, and then we will teach you things that are subtley more difficult.
                                          <br>
                                          And at the end of these courses and lessons, you will be assigned to make something in Blender using the things that you learn.
                                          <br>
                                          If you are confused about when is say CTRL, Mac users will have to use CMD.
                                          <br>
                                          Don't panic if you mess something up in Blender, you can just press CTRL + Z (CMD + Z for Mac)
                                          <br>
                                          Also, the background you see behind this text was indeed made in Blender. And you can make these backgrounds too!
                                          <br>
                                          Good luck, and happy blending!

                                           <p>
                                             Before we can use Blender, we need to get it first. I would highly recommend Blender 3.0 since these chapters are targetted to that specific version of Blender.
                                             <br>
                                             It would of course be fine if you used a more recent version, but following the instructions on Blender 3.0 may cause a few issues to people using an outdated version.
                                             <br>

                                             Once you open up Blender and press General, you will see a new Blender project. Your blender project should look like the image below.

                                             Also, the image below has different colored circles or squares around them. The list below the image will tell you what each color means.

                                        Animation allows for movement in your project so it is obvioulsy very important for Blender users to learn it!

                                          Pink: Auto Keyframe (Automatically adds a keyframe to the selected frame when there are any changes to a slected object)

                                      <h2> Chapter 5: Edit Mode
                                        <p>
                                          You can enter Edit Mode by pressing TAB while selecting an object. When you do, you will see dots on the corners of the object. These dots are called vertices.
                                          <br>
                                          If you press a dot and then press G, you can alter the shape of that region. Edit Mode is mostly used for modeling, but can be used to assign materials into specific sections.
                                          <br>
                                          Find the cube icon in the top left of the viewport. This is the surface selector, and if you press I, you can make a second surface inside that one. Scale it down, and then extrude it with E.
                                          <br>
                                          You should get something like the image shown below:

                                            Go ahead and mess around with the different tools in the left of the viewport display so that you can feel familiar with the accesible tools.

                                        <h2> Chapter 6: Rendering and Render Engines
                                          <p>
                                            Render Engines are very important because they can change the entire look of your scene. For example, Eevee has real-time rendering. But Cycles has a better render result and has more realistic lighting.
                                            <br>
                                            <img src="C:\\Users\\User\\CodaKid\\Projects\\Html5\\Blender for dummies\\Images\\Image 2.png" alt="">
                                            <br>
                                            You can easily switch between Render Engines any time, and some Render Engines have alternate features than others. I suggest Eevee for beginners because it is real-time and it has nearly instant renders.
                                            <br>
                                            To render your scene, you need a camera and you can use F12 as a shortcut to render. The render will combine all physics and lighting and the final image is shown through the eyes of the camera. So camera orientation is important when rendering (More on that later).
                                            <br>
                                            When using Cycles, if you have a strong enough GPU, please use GPU Compute because it allows for faster renders.

                                            <p>
                                              Camera Orientation is one of the most important things when making a scene. You wouldn't want to make an incredible donut but make the camera look at a wall!
                                              <br>
                                              Add a camera to your scene and press R twice to rotate it in the way you want it to look. Press the camera icon in the top right of the viewport display to look into the camera.
                                              <br>
                                              This is what you should see when you go into camera view (I'm using the model we made in chapter 5):
                                              <br>

                                              <br>
                                              you can go into the camera settings to change some stuff to make your camera work better. But too much tweaking could lead to some weird results!
